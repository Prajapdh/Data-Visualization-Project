# Data Visualization Project

In this project I would be using python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to sort data and visualize it by plotting different types of graphs.

I have used a pokemon dataset from kaggle and data can be found here: [Pokemon.csv](https://github.com/Prajapdh/Python-Projects/files/9533623/Pokemon.csv)

You can choose to see different types of graphs for a few types for pokemon. I know this project doesn't serve any issues, I created this project because it was a great learning experince for me.

To try the project, you could run [project.py](https://github.com/Prajapdh/Python-Projects/blob/master/project.py) or see the output images that program generates in the [output](https://github.com/Prajapdh/Python-Projects/tree/master/images/output%20images) folder.
